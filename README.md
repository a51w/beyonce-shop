This project is a group work I developed with my colleague, focusing on an Online Shopping Website designed to meet user needs in terms of convenience, security, and efficiency.

The system has two main user groups: General Users and Admins.

For General Users:
The website provides a user-friendly and fast experience. Products are displayed in an organized manner, with an efficient search function to help users find items easily. It supports multiple online payment methods, reducing issues from cash-on-delivery. A real-time order tracking system keeps customers updated throughout the delivery process. In addition, a customer review system builds trust and confidence in purchase decisions.

For Admins:
The system is designed for easy and efficient management. Admins can update product details, monitor stock, and manage data quickly. A real-time dashboard provides sales analytics and statistics, helping admins track sales trends, plan purchases, and make business decisions. The system also supports promotional announcements to attract users and boost sales.

In summary, this online shopping website meets the needs of both users and admins. It ensures efficiency, convenience, and security while improving purchasing decisions, minimizing order and delivery issues, and supporting effective online business management.
